# Informatics-Preamble
Helpful datastructures and templates when doing informatics problems in C++. See `Preamble.cpp`  for example usage.

My goal for this is to abstract the nitty gritty of implementations, so that informatics can be focused towards solving interesting problems instead. Hopefully this also makes informatics more accessible to newbies.

Please let me know if there are any errors.

Functionalities include
 - lazy persistent segtrees
 - directed / undirected graphs: graph traversal, MST, SSC, Toposort, bridges detection, ...
 - trees: traversals + LCA with jump pointers
 - mod arithmetic integers
 - matricies
 - 2D grids of values
 - convex hull trick
